About the project:

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective spam email classification system using machine learning techniques deployed via a Flask web application. The system allows users to input email content, and the application returns a classification result indicating whether the email is spam or not spam.



FEATURES :
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to classify emails based on their content and 
Flask Web Application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the classification system.



Pre-requisites:
Python 3.x,
Flask,
Scikit-learn (for machine learning model) and 
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt



Usage:
1. Train the machine learning model using your dataset (not provided in this repository).

2. Save the trained model as a '.pkl' file and save it in 'models'

3. Run the Flask application (python run.py)

4. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.



Acknowledgement:
This project was inspired by the need for a practical application of machine learning in spam email detection.

Thanks to the Flask and Scikit-learn communities for their valuable contributions.
